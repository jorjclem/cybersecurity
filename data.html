    <h1>How can we protect against transmitted data?</h1>
        <h2> Encryption is the main form of protection we can use for transmitting data. It can make it unreadable for unintended users. 
            Decryption is what is used to read the encrypted data. For example, users sending the email will have an encryption key that only is tied to the users decryption key.
